Project Overview 
Understanding Security Policies and Their Foundations
Security policies are foundational documents that guide an organization’s approach to data protection, access control, incident response  and overall cybersecurity governance.
Before drafting any security policy, it’s important to understand the key elements that influence how policies are created and enforced.
 Laws – Legal requirements an organization must follow when handling sensitive data.Standards – Industry frameworks like NIST and ISO that provide structured controls.
 Policies – High-level rules and expectations for employees, systems, and data.
 Procedures – Detailed step-by-step instructions that operationalize a policy.
This project explores each of these components and demonstrates how to use frameworks and templates to create professional grade policies for an organization named Bayotech Solutions.
